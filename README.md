### How to use
You can download the Blynk Application from Playstore if you an Android User. You can also install the Blynk Application on IOS from App Store.

Now lets setup the Blynk App for IoT Home Automation Project. First, open the application and create a new account using your Email ID. Then click on “New Project“.

### Purpose
Mini Project for Bachelor of Technology, 


### Android Application
 -Here is a Blynk Based Home Automation Code, you can copy the code and paste it in your Arduino IDE. But before that, you need to add Blynk Library to Arduino IDE.
